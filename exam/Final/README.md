1. Observational data is what we perceive of the nature. Reality is what we will never know because it is always obfuscated with our biases and measurement uncertainties.  
2. "All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting
graphic." To name a few would be like color, shape, size, position, line style, and texture.  
3. The top one.
4. A.
5. (A) Valid  
   (B) Valid  
   (C) Invalid  
   (D) Invalid  
   (E) Invalid  
   (F) Invalid
6. Theory, Experiment, Computation.
7. No. “The sky is rainy” implies that “the sky is cloudy”. However, rainy sky did not physically cause the cloudy sky.
8. (A) No, the data's "average" does not correlate with the red line.
   (B)
   (C) 
9. No.
10. .
11. 1 -> 1, 01 -> 1, 10 -> 2  
12. No, numbers in the real world are infinite, like pi which can go on forever, computers are limited and can mainly handle a fixed amount of digits.
13. ![Question 13](./HW49.jpg)
14. Git is the software for version control, github is the service that uses Git.
15. Bayesian school of probabilty.
16. Bayesian school of probabilty.
17. Frequentist school of probablity.
18. The visualization's x-axis starts at a number before 0. The axis represents age and you can't have negative age.
19. Because computer operate using binary code (0s and 1s).
20. B.
21. Fortran.
22. ![Question 22](./Final22.jpeg)
23. ![Question 23](./final23.jpeg)  
24.(A) Deductive reasoning: If A is true, then B is true.  
   (B) Plausible reasoning: If A is true, then B is more likely to be true.
25. It means they have the same truth value.
26. ![Question 23](./final26.jpeg)
27. .
28. S=1638. 99+3 = 102. (102 x 33)/2 = 1638. add the last and first term to give the total of a pair in between the summations then mulitple by the amount of numbers, then divide by 2 to in count for the pairs.
29. .
30. C = A+B, C is true when A or B is true, the negation of C is Cˉ and (A+B)ˉ = Aˉ*Bˉ. So it can be seen as Cˉ = (A+B)ˉ= Aˉ*Bˉ.  
31. .
32. (A) Quantum, Prababilistic, Measurment, Chaotic, Cosmological.  
    (B) Quantum.
