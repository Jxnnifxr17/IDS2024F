1) Cache Memory.  
2) To ensure balance in speed, size, cost, and work.  
3) HDD.
4) Registers, L1 Cache, L2 Cache, L3 Cache, DRAM, Disk.
5) Bit.
6) We use binary because it makes it simple to represent data and electronically.
7) ?
8) 1940s.  
9) 1940s.
10) A program that runs based solely on the algorithms that was physically wired and built.
11) ENIAC or desk calculator.
12) Declarative has to with statment or facts while imperative has to do the process of doing something.
13) A) declarative.  
    B) declarative.  
    C) imperative.  
    D) imperative.  
    E) declarative.  
14) Both declarative and imperative.
15) ENIC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer).
16) Python.
17) Fortran.
18) input, mathematical/logical operations, conditional execution, repetition/looping, output.
19) desk calculator.
20) FORTRAN, COLBOL, B, C++, Java, Python.
21. A) Imperative.  
    B) No.  
22) A) Fortran.  
    B) Since 1950s.  
23) A) Assembly.  
    B) third, third, third, fourth, fourth, fourth.  
24) 1970s, 1980s, 1980s, 1990s.  
25) B.  
26) C, Simula.    
27) Fortran and C.  
28) I would define a logarithm is the exponent where the base is raised to give a number.
29) 1638. 99+3 = 102. (102 x 33)/2 = 1638. add the last and first term to give the total of a pair in between the summations then mulitple by the amount of numbers, then divide by 2 to in count for the pairs.  
30) Magnetic Tapes are typically longer lasting, and approximate 15-30 years while HDD approximate 3-5 years.
31) desk calculator.
32) 10^5050. using (n(n+1))/2, where n is 100 (the last number) = (100 x 10)/2= 5050 which would equal our exponent.
