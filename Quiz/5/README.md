1.  π represents "Probability." So In summary, 
π(A∣B) mathematically expresses the value, probability, or distribution of A, taking into account the condition that B has occurred.
2. Classical, Empirical, Subjective, Axiomatic.  
3. Subjective/Bayesian.  
4. Frequentist.
5. Subjective because this is the porbability of something existing. God is based on blief so it's subjective but many believe that it does exists.
6. No, Bayesian uses probability as a degree of belief and incorporates prior information, while Frequentist relies on long-run frequencies and does not use prior beliefs.
7. Bayesian inference.
8. Bayesian probability is popular among physicists and engineers because it incorporates prior knowledge and works well for unique or non-repeatable experiments, while Frequentist probability is favored by biologists and social scientists because it relies on repeated experiments and large datasets for objective conclusions.
9. 16th Century.  
10. Random, Systematic, Model, Measurement, Sampling, Human.  
11. Human.  
12. "All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic." To name a few would be like color, shape, size, position, line style, and texture.
13. Continuous and Non-Continuous. "Those that can represent continuous data and those that cannot."
14. Factors are the general variables you're interested in, and levels are the specific values or categories those factors can take.
15. The two major types of data are qualitative data and quantitative data. Qualitative data describes characteristics or categories, such as favorite color example: red, blue, green. Quantitative data, involves numerical values that can be measured, such as age example: 25 years, 30 years.
16. Factors.  
17. A) Ordered Example: 1st place," "2nd place," "3rd place."  
    B) Un-ordered Example: "Blue," "Green," "Brown," "Gray."
18. A) Sequential: Best for representing ordered, continuous data where values increase or decrease in a linear fashion, such as temperature, elevation, or income.  
    B) Diverging: Ideal for visualizing data with a meaningful midpoint, often zero, where values can be both positive and negative. This type of scale helps to emphasize deviation from a neutral value, with one color representing positive values and another representing negative values.  
    C) Qualitative: Suitable for categorical data that has no inherent ordering. Each category is assigned a distinct color, making it easy to differentiate between different groups or classes.  
    D) Monochromatic: Best for continuous data where you want to emphasize a smooth transition across a wide range of values, typically from low to high. This scale uses a variety of colors to represent different values, providing a perceptually uniform transition that is also colorblind-friendly.
19. 3D plots can be harder to interpret and sometimes provide less clarity.
20. Zip codes can be considered numerical data, like for geographical reasons or as labels to identify specific areas.
21. Categorical/unordered aesthetic.
22. all of them.  
23. The top one.  
24. A) Chicago.  
    B) Death Valley.
    C) San Diego.  
    D) San Diego.
25. A.  
26. Periodic Data Set.
27. Accent color scales, Okabe Ito Accent.
28. The names of the movies should be on the vertical axis rather than the bottom while the "weekend gross (million USD) should be on the hortizontal rather than the vertical.  
29. A) Increase.  
    B) 2 degree celsius.
