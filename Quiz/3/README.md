1. Scientific inference involves observing phenomena, asking questions, forming and testing hypotheses through experiments, analyzing data, and drawing conclusions to enhance understanding of the natural world.
2. Experiment, Theory, Computation and Data.  
3. In these applications, computation and data enhance scientific research by providing powerful tools for experiment and theory, often making experimentation more efficient or even unnecessary in some cases.  
4. Deductive and plausible reasoning.
5. The realtionship between osbervational data and reality is that it is a collection of data that is. We can observe reality but we can also conduct data without it.
6. Validation checks if the model is accurate and reliable against real-world data, while calibration adjusts model parameters to improve accuracy based on known data.  
7. No they are not the same. Example: Logical Implication: If it is raining (A), then the ground will be wet (B). This is a logical relationship; if A is true, B must follow logically. Physical Causation: If you drop a glass (cause), it will break when it hits the floor (effect). Here, the breaking of the glass is caused by the action of dropping it.

11. Both proporsitions are equal, they will have the same truth.   
12. When you add two propositions that complement each other, the result is always true. Example: If P is true (it is raining), then ¬P is false (it is not raining). If P is false (it is not raining), then  ¬P is true (it is raining).  
13. When you multiply two propositions that complement each other, the result is always false. If P is true (it is raining), then ¬P is false (it is not raining). If P is false (it is not raining), then ¬P is true (it is raining).
