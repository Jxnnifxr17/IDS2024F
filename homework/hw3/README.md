1. Experiment and Theory???
2. .
3. Deductive and plausible reasoning.
4. Observational data is what we collect through seeing or measuring things, while reality is everything that exists, whether we observe it or not.   
5. Prediction Senario: Quantity of Interest, Validation Senario: Validation Data, Calibration Scenario: Calibration Data.  
6. A statement that can be either true or false, but not both.  
7. No, it cant be both true or false. If someone was to say "It is raining" and also said "It is not raining"  at the same time, it would cause a contradiction.  
8. No, A⇒B could mean if A is true, then B is true, but that does not mean that if B is true, A must be true. Example: "It is raining" (A) "The ground is wet" (B). If it is raining, then the ground is wet is valid, but if the ground is wet, then it is raining isnt valid.

12. If it is raining, then the ground is wet.  
13. If a person is crawling out of a broken window of a jewelry store at night, wearing a mask, and carrying a bag full of expensive jewelry, then they are most likely a burglar and therefore dishonest.  
14. A) Bit.  
    B) A bit is like a switch that can be either off (0) or on (1). It’s the simplest way to represent information because it has only two options.  
    C1) 1 box: 2 states (on or off).  
    C2) 2 boxes: 4 states (on-on, on-off, off-on, off-off).  
    C3) 3 boxes: 8 states (on-on-on, on-on-off, on-off-on, on-off-off, off-on-on, off-on-off, off-off-on, off-off-off).
