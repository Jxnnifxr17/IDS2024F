24) Dennard Scaling is the observation that as transistors get smaller, their power consumption reduces proportionally, keeping the overall power density of transistors roughly the same. There's no difference in Dennard Scaling and MOSFET scaling, they're interchangable. While Moore's Law is the prediction or idea that the transistor count in microprocessors will double every two years.

28) In a 2D plot, exponential behavior shows a curve that rises steeply, while power-law behavior results in a straight line on a log-log plot, indicating a consistent relationship between the two variables.
