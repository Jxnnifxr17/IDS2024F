1. 
2. Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer.
3. Because computer operate using binary code (0s and 1s).
4. The CPU.
5. Hard Drive Disks.
6. bit.
7. A) Assembly language.  
   B) Yes.  
8) A) Fortran.  
   B) Since 1950s.  
9) A) Assembly.  
   B) third, third, third, fourth, fourth, fourth.  
10) 1970s, 1980s, 1980s, 1990s.  
11) B.  
12) C, Simula.  
13) Fortran and C.  
14) CPU Registers/Cache.
15) Bit.
16) 10 times faster.
17) 10,000 times faster.
18) 100,000 times faster.  
19) Base, collector, Emitter.
20) Adding more would mean shrinking them, however this causes malufunctions in them, like over heating.  
21) Fetch, decode, and execute.  
22) Yes, because if the CPU is fast it will struggle with slow memory access.  
23) Memory Access since CPU speed increase they now operate at speeds the exceed the typical memory access speed.  
24) Dennard Scaling is the observation that as transistors get smaller, their power consumption reduces proportionally, keeping the overall power density of transistors roughly the same. There's no difference in Dennard Scaling and MOSFET scaling, they're interchangable. While Moore's Law is the prediction or idea that the transistor count in microprocessors will double every two years.  
25) A) 64.  
    B) 2080.  
    C) 0.2971 pounds.
26) A) 9,223,372,036,854,775,808.  
    B) 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.  
    C) 2,635,249,195,257,865.2.  
    D) About 1,317,624,598.  
27) A) accessing the memory.  
    B) iteration.  
    C) branching.  
28) In a 2D plot, exponential behavior shows a curve line only on the X-axis on log-scale, while power-law behavior results in a line on a log-scale on both X-axis and Y-axis on a log-scale.
