3. "All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic." To name a few would be like color, shape, size, position, line style, and texture.
4. "Those that can represent continuous data and those that cannot."
5. The two major types of data are qualitative data (descriptive, non-numerical) and quantitative data (numerical, measurable); an example of qualitative data is someone's favorite color, while an example of quantitative data is their height in centimeters.
6. The common name for variables holding qualitative data is factors.

8.  A) Month: Qualitative, Categorical, Discrete, Ordered.  
    B) Day: Quantitative, Numerical, Discrete, Ordered.
    C) Location: Qualitative, Categorical, Discrete, Unordered.
    D) Station ID: Qualitative, Categorical, Discrete, Unordered.
    E) Temperature: Quantitative, Numerical, Continous, Unordered.

10. A logarithmic scale for exponential growth data, can improve visualization by making trends more linear and revealing patterns that would be difficult to see on a linear scale.

12. A data set that exhibits periodicity or cyclical patterns is best visualized in polar coordinates, such as daily temperature variations across the year.
13. A) Sequential: Best for representing ordered, continuous data where values increase or decrease in a linear fashion, such as temperature, elevation, or income.  
    B) Diverging: Ideal for visualizing data with a meaningful midpoint, often zero, where values can be both positive and negative. This type of scale helps to emphasize deviation from a neutral value, with one color representing positive values and another representing negative values.  
    C) Qualitative: Suitable for categorical data that has no inherent ordering. Each category is assigned a distinct color, making it easy to differentiate between different groups or classes.  
    D) Monochromatic: Best for continuous data where you want to emphasize a smooth transition across a wide range of values, typically from low to high. This scale uses a variety of colors to represent different values, providing a perceptually uniform transition that is also colorblind-friendly.

21. I see two living creatures: a horse and a frog.  
22. Take the 2nd stick on the left(the stick that points downward) of the sticks that makes the number 8 and place it in the middle, horizontally of the sticks that makes the number 0. Giving you 9+3-4=8, which would be true.
